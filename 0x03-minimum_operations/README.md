# 0x03. Minimum Operations

## Information
- Langauge: Python 3.4.3
- OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Thar)

## The challenge
In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.
- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`

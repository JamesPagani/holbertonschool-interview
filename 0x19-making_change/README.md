# 0x19. Making Change

## Developed on...
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Thar)
- **Language**: Python (3.4.3)
- **Answer file**: 0-making_change.py

## The Challenge
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.
- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`.
- Return: Fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`.
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possesion.
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`.
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list.

### Running the project
Should you want to run this file, follow these steps:

1. Import the script into your file.
```python
makeChange = __import__('0-making_change.py').makeChange
```
2. Use Python's `print` command, passing the function as the value.
```pyhton
print(makeChange([1, 2, 3], 4))
```

While made for Python 3.4.3, it should have no problem running on later releases.

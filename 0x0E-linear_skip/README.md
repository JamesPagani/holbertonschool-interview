# 0x0E. Linear search in skip list

## The challenge
Create a function that searches for a value in a sorted (ascending order) skip list of integers.

### What is a skip list?
A skip list is a derivate of linked lists. Aside from having the normal lane, which goes through each node, skip lists also feature one or more "express lanes", which **skips** through nodes. How the express lane(s) is/are implemented is up to the developer.

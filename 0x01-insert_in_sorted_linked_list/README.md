# Insert in sorted linked list

## Information
- Language: C (Compiled in gcc 4.8.4)
- OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Thar)

## The challenge
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
- Prototype: `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);`
- Return: the address of the new node, or `NULL`if it failed.

To avoid copying, this folder will only contain the required files:
- 0-insert_number.c, which contains the function
- lists.h, which contains the structure and additional functions to use.

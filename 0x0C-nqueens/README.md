# 0x0C - N Queens

## Information
- Langauge: Python (3.4.3)
- Compiled in: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## The challenge
The N Queens puzzle consists of placing N Queens in a NxN board in such a way that no Queen can attack each other. The challenge here is to write a program that, given N as an argument, prints all possible solutions to this puzzle.

**To keep in mind:**
- An individual solution is given as a list of coordinates of each Queen's position.
- `N` has to be equal or higher to 4.
    - `N = 1` has only one solution, and `N = 2` and `N = 3` have no solutions at all.

# 0x0B. C# - Interfaces

## About
***This project reviews the concept of interfaces and how C# implements it.***

C#'s *interfaces* are similar to the general concept: Being a structure (...). However, since C# does not have multiple inheritance of classes, multiple inheritance of *interfaces* is used instead (and it is also the only way for structs to inherit anything).

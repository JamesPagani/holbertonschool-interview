# 0x0A. 2048 (single line)

## About
This project attempts to recreate part of the rules of [2048](https://play2048.co/), but instead of having a 4x4 grid, we're focusing on one line (of varying sizes).

The objective here is: Given a direction, an array of integers, and its size, **move all elments of the array, merging them together if they have the same value**.

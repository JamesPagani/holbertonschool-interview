A _Max Binary Heap_ is a type of _binary tree_ where all elements are inserted from the left-most leaf to the right-most one, and they are sorted according to the value of the nodes. In a **max** heap, the value of the **parents** nodes must be higher than or equal to the value of its **child** nodes.
